just run the image100.py model, It will import CIFAR-10 dataset from the keras automatically , and train the model on datasets , after training it will test on test data and give the accuracy as 72.50 % on test data. 
  
you can just run the json image load model.py to check the model.
there are so many models , you can just change the model names and get the scores.
